## Logistics

1. All assignments will be submitted on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/479037). 
    1. Your two lowest in-class activity scores will be dropped.
    1. For every 24 hours late that a submission is made, it will be penalized
    5%, for up to 4 days, after which no submissions will be accepted. The only
    exception for late acceptance will be in documented medical or family
    emergencies.
1. Grading
    1. We will use the following weights in the grade calculation: Final Project (30%), Homework (50%), In-Class Activities (20%)
    1. Grades will be assigned according to the percentage scale, A = 92-100, AB = 88-91.9, B = 82-87.9, BC = 78-81.9, C = 70-77.9, D = 60-69.9, F = 0-59.9; and according to the percentile scale, A = 75, AB = 65, B = 45, BC = 30, C = 10, D = 5, F = 0. Your grade will be the higher of these two grades.
