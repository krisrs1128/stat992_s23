## Course Description


Modern biology increasingly relies on high-throughput, multi-omics data generation to solve complex scientific problems. For example, multi-omics data collection is central in current efforts to improve cancer treatment, understand the factors underlying mental health, and respond to climate change. However, managing, exploring, and drawing inference from these data is notoriously complex. Each modality reflects a different view (e.g., transcriptional, taxonomic, or chemical) of the samples under study, and simply analyzing each source separately fails to support the cross-modality comparisons of central scientific interest.

By drawing wisely from the statistical toolbox, it is possible to build more useful, integrated portraits of complex systems from multi-omics data. Moreover, with their experience comparing and critiquing data analysis procedures, statisticians have the potential to support the design of accessible and effective multi-omics workflows. This course will help you navigate the literature, giving opportunities to gain hands-on experience with the central data sources and statistical methods in the field. You will develop skill in reading, implementing, and evaluating the types of methods being actively developed for multi-omics data analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

By the conclusion of the course, you will be able to,

1.	Design and implement benchmarking studies (using both simulated and real data) to clarify the properties of existing multi-omics data analysis workflows.
1.	Compare and contrast sequencing technologies and study designs widely used in modern multi-omic studies.
1.	Write accessible technical reviews and prepare minimal code demos that translate theoretical advances in statistics to the multi-omics data analysis context.
1.	Apply and critique R packages for visualization and modeling of multi-omic data.
1.	Navigate the multi-omics literature, prepare academic peer reviews, and plan well-motivated research projects in the area.
